# Schema Design Status

The final business schema is still deferred, but the current Auth foundation
defines a PostgreSQL/EF Core schema with checked-in migrations under
`services/auth/Data/Migrations`.

The Auth schema contains users, roles, permissions, device installations,
active sessions, session lifecycle logs, rotating refresh-token records and the
two many-to-many assignment tables. It includes unique email/name/code
constraints, one active session row per user/device pair, session-version
state, absolute expiration, foreign-key cascade behavior, token-version
revocation state, system-role protection and `CreatedAt`/`UpdatedAt` fields
where applicable. Auth enforces a maximum of five active account sessions for
one installation and five active sessions per account across installations.

## Auth session tables

| Table | Important fields and constraints |
|---|---|
| `DeviceInstallations` | Server-issued `DeviceId` primary key, hashed `DeviceKeyHash`, legacy marker, last-seen and revocation timestamps. The device key is never stored in plaintext. |
| `ActiveSessions` | Only currently active session rows; unique `(UserId, DeviceId)`, JWT `SessionVersion`, `CreatedAt`, `LastSeenAt`, absolute `ExpiresAt`, `RememberMe` and a foreign key to the installation. |
| `UserSessionLogs` | Append-only ended-session records with the original lifecycle fields, `EndedAt` and bounded `EndReason`; never used for authentication. |
| `RefreshTokens` | Unique SHA-256 token hash, session/family IDs, issued and expiry timestamps, consumed/revoked timestamps, replacement link and revocation reason. Each row references exactly one active session or session log. Raw refresh tokens are never persisted. |

`20260921033902_AuthSessionLifecycle` backfills legacy device-installation
rows from existing `UserSessions` before adding the installation foreign key
and gives pre-existing sessions a one-day migration expiration.

`20260921133008_ActiveSessionsAndSessionLogs` separates active and ended
sessions without losing history. Existing valid rows are moved to
`ActiveSessions`; revoked or expired rows are moved to `UserSessionLogs`; and
refresh-token references are transferred to the corresponding log rows when a
session is archived.

The eventual schema documentation must include:

- ER diagram
- table definitions
- keys
- relationships
- constraints
- indexes
- audit fields
- migration strategy
- seed data
- Agentic AI workflow-state tables, if required

Business-domain schema should be introduced according to the approved v1/v2/v3 component design rather than prematurely in v0.
